### Is Genius a Bug? Cracking the Code of P vs NP

Imagine I hand you two Sudoku puzzles.
For the first, I give you a completely filled-in grid and ask, "Is this a valid solution?" You could check it pretty quickly. A quick scan of the rows, columns, and boxes, and you'd have your answer in a minute or two. It's a simple, mechanical task.

For the second, I give you a mostly empty grid and ask, "Can you solve this?" That's a different story. You might stare at it for hours, testing possibilities, backtracking, and waiting for that flash of insight.
